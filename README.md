# CFX-800
The Casio CFX-400 is the most powerful calculator watch Casio ever produced. Released in 1985, it's one of the few calculator watches that had support for trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentials, and more.

The CFX-800 is intended to be a successor to this 'holy grail of calculator watches', by creating a custom board for the DBC-611, a Casio calculator watch still in production today.

Ideally, it will implement all of the same functionality as the classic CFX-400 but with more precise and accurate timekeeping, support for more than two time zones, unit conversion, and more.

This project is based around the Microchip PIC24FJ128GC010 which is the only MCU that has support for the 255 segments in the DBC-611's LCD, as well as low-power RTC to enable an estimated 2yr battery life.

PCB design is currently underway, and will hopefully be done by EOY 2025.
